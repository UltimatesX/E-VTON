# E-VTON - Problem : Glaucoma is a common eye disease that can cause blindness if not treated in time. To control it, checking the pressure inside the eye (IOP) regularly is very important. Right now, most methods to measure IOP need touching the eye, using eye drops to numb it, and trained doctors. Some non-contact methods exist, like air-puff machines, but they are big and expensive, so they are mostly used in hospitals. The goal is to create a low-cost, safe, and easy-to-use device that doesn’t touch the eye and can be used by people at home to check their eye pressure regularly.


solution - Glaucoma affects millions globally, and regular IOP monitoring is essential for early detection and ongoing management. Currently, most accurate devices are expensive, clinic-based, and require trained professionals. By offering a portable, affordable, and user-friendly alternative, this device fills a critical gap—making home monitoring accessible, especially in remote or underserved areas.
Target customers could include patients with glaucoma, elderly users, optometrists, home healthcare providers, and even telemedicine platforms. The device can be sold directly to consumers through pharmacies or online platforms, and potentially offered as a subscription service with app integration for tracking and alerts. Clinics and small diagnostic centers could also adopt it as a low-cost tool for community screenings. In the long term, partnerships with eye hospitals, health tech startups, or insurance providers could boost distribution and credibility. This innovation not only supports preventive care but also aligns well with the growing demand for smart, connected health devices in the digital health space.
